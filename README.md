# Comparing-Pretrained-Language-Models-for-Molecular-Activity-Prediction
We predict the pCHEMBL values, AlogP values, Molecular Weight and nunmber of Lipinski's Rule of 5 Violations of a biomolecule by end to end training multiple pretrained Language models, on Dopamine D2 active compounds sourced from the CHeMBL database.
